# Gibbs Sampling interactive demo
This repository contains Interactive demo for Gibbs Sampling, submitted in the course CS698X, IITK: Topics in Probabilistic Modelling and Inference.
<p />
The likelihood is a normal distribution with unknown mean and variance and semi-conjugate priors for the unknown parameters, i.e. the mean has a normal prior while the covariance has an Inverse-Gamma prior.
<p />
The code can be used to obtain join posterior distribution on the unknown parameters using Gibbs sampling algorithm as well as obtain interactive GIF for the algorithm:
